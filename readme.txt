REDACTED Backend API Solution
        by Andre053

##############################


This solution was created in 220 minutes and attempts to cover all parts of the Hatchways assessment.

I chose to use Python to complete this task, utilizing the Flask library, as well as the aiohttp and threading libraries.

The majority of print statements have been removed, but I have left the ones that check the cache when an API request is made as I believe it helps illustrate the use of the data structure.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.
